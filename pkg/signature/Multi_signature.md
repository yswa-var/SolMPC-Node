### 1. Choose a Library

for a BLS-based threshold signature scheme, which is commonly used due to its efficiency in aggregation, you might need to implement it manually or use components from libraries like **go.dedis.ch/kyber/v3**.

### 2. Key Components Implementation

#### KeyGenerator

- **Purpose:** Generate and distribute key shares.
- **Workflow:**
  1. Use Shamir's Secret Sharing to split the master secret.
  2. Distribute shares securely.

#### Participant

- **Purpose:** Sign with a private key share.
- **Workflow:**
  1. Initialize with participant ID and private key share.
  2. Create a partial signature using BLS signing.

#### Aggregator

- **Purpose:** Combine partial signatures.
- **Workflow:**
  1. Collect at least t partial signatures.
  2. Combine them using BLS signature aggregation.

### 4. Integration with Blockchain

For integrating with blockchains like Solana, you would typically:

- Use the combined threshold signature in transactions.
- Submit the transaction with the single combined signature.
- Verification is done using the group public key, similar to a single signature.

### Simplifications for POC

- **Use Existing Libraries:** Leverage libraries like **okx/threshold-lib** or **github.com/niclabs/tcrsa** for simpler cryptographic primitives.
- **Focus on Core Logic:** Implement the key components (KeyGenerator, Participant, Aggregator) and focus on the signing and verification logic.
- **Simplify Key Distribution:** you can simulate secure key distribution by directly passing shares to participants.
