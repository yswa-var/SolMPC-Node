# Tilt-Valid: MPC-Based Distributed Validator System for Solana

## 🔐 Overview

**Tilt-Valid** is a modular, threshold-based validator framework built for the Solana blockchain. It enables secure, distributed transaction signing via **Multi-Party Computation (MPC)**, ensuring no single validator has access to the full private key. This design increases robustness and decentralization in validator operations.

## 🎯 Strategic Vision: Validator Infrastructure + Secure Treasury System for DAOs

**Tilt-Valid** is positioned to become the foundational infrastructure for **secure DAO treasury management** and **distributed validator operations** on Solana and beyond.

### ✅ Why This Combo Wins:

#### 1. **Directly Useful to Solana & PoS Ecosystems**

- Solana's validator economy is huge and performance-focused
- Tilt-Valid showcases practical security in real-time signing — very relevant to Jito, Lido, Marinade, Helium, etc.
- Addresses the critical need for secure, distributed validator operations

#### 2. **DAO Treasury Security = Hot Pain Point**

- Projects like Juicebox, Aragon, and Gnosis already show traction here
- Most existing solutions lack verifiable randomness and scalable MPC
- You can position Tilt-Valid as a modular vault and treasury engine, powered by MPC

#### 3. **VRF + MPC is Rare and Credible**

- There are few open-source examples combining these two technologies
- This makes your repo uniquely valuable for devs, VCs, or foundations to notice
- Creates a defensible moat in the validator infrastructure space

### 🚀 Future Roadmap

| Phase       | Focus                         | Target Market                        |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Phase 1** | Core MPC + VRF Infrastructure | Solana Validators, Staking Pools     |
| **Phase 2** | DAO Treasury Integration      | DAO Governance, Multi-sig Upgrades   |
| **Phase 3** | Cross-chain Expansion         | Ethereum, Polygon, Other PoS Chains  |
| **Phase 4** | Enterprise Features           | Institutional DeFi, Compliance Tools |

## ✨ Key Features

- **Threshold MPC**: Uses a `t-of-n` scheme to collaboratively sign transactions.
- **Secure DKG (Distributed Key Generation)**: Keys are generated without revealing any secret to a single validator.
- **VRF-Based Validator Selection**: Ensures fair and verifiable leader election.
- **Solana Native Integration**: Builds and submits real Solana transactions.
- **Pluggable Tilt Distributions**: Modular support for `simple`, `subtilt`, and `nested` payout structures.
- **CLI Operable**: Quickly simulate validator clusters from the command line.
- **MVP with Working Demo**: Fully functional prototype running on Solana Devnet.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Validator Initialization**
   - Validators join the network with their own ID and config.
2. **Distributed Key Generation**
   - Validators jointly compute a shared public key and retain private key shares.
3. **Transaction Construction**
   - A tilt (payment structure) is parsed and turned into Solana instructions.
4. **MPC Signing**
   - Validators jointly compute a signature without revealing secrets.
5. **VRF Selection**
   - Verifiable randomness selects a leader to broadcast the transaction.
6. **Submission**
   - The leader sends the signed transaction to the Solana network.

## 🚀 Running a Validator Node

```bash
go run cmd/main.go <validator_id> --tilt-type=<tilt_type>
```

**Arguments:**

- `<validator_id>`: Unique ID for each validator (e.g., 1, 2, 3)
- `--tilt-type=`: Choose one of:

  - `simple`: Single recipient tilt
  - `one_subtilt`: One-level nested
  - `two_subtilts`: Two sub-tilts (original behavior)
  - `nested`: Fully nested recursive structure

---

## 🛡 Security Design

- ✅ **No single-point signing**: Private keys are never reconstructed.
- ✅ **Threshold fault tolerance**: System is functional even if `n - t` nodes are offline.
- ✅ **Replay protection**: Nonce and blockhash management.
- ✅ **VRF-based validator election**: Prevents manipulation in leader selection.

## 🔧 Configuration

Via config files or environment variables:

- Validator paths and identities
- Threshold value `t`
- Tilt type
- Logging level
- Future: Replace file-exchange with libp2p or gRPC transport
