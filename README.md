# Tilt Validator Node

This project implements a **validator node** that participates in the Tilt payment distribution flow on the Solana blockchain. The system ensures **secure and tamper-resistant payouts** through a decentralised, threshold-based approach. Validators work collaboratively off-chain to compute distributions, with the final result secured by an on-chain verified aggregated signature. This approach minimises trust and maximises transparency within the Tilt ecosystem.
