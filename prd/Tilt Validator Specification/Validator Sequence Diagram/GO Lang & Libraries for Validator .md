# GO Lang & Libraries for Validator

Below is a **high-level specification** for implementing the validator logic in **Go**. It includes the major steps (subset selection, data gathering, computing distribution, partial signatures, and final aggregation) along with suggested **Go libraries** you might use for each component. This is just a **starting point**; you can adapt it to match your infrastructure, threshold-signature scheme, and naming conventions.

---

## 1. Overview

**Objective**: Implement a **validator node** that participates in the Tilt payment distribution flow. Each validator node:

1. Joins a selected **subset** of validators.
2. Gathers on-chain state from Solana.
3. Computes the final `(recipients[], amounts[])` distribution.
4. Generates a **partial signature** of the final message.
5. Sends partial signatures to an **aggregator** node to be merged into a single aggregated signature.

Finally, an **aggregator** broadcasts the signed transaction to the **Tilt program** on Solana.

## 2. Core Components and Recommended Libraries

1. **Solana RPC & On-Chain Data**
    - **Library**: [github.com/gagliardetto/solana-go](https://github.com/gagliardetto/solana-go) or [github.com/portto/solana-go-sdk](https://github.com/portto/solana-go-sdk)
    - **Usage**:
        - Establish an RPC client to connect to a Solana cluster (Mainnet, Testnet, Devnet, or localnet).
        - Fetch `AccountInfo` for the Tilt Program Derived Address (PDA), retrieving data such as:
            - Tilt’s balance
            - Business rules or ephemeral weighting
            - Sub-tilt references, etc.
2. **Threshold Signatures & Cryptography**
    - **Library (Possible Options)**:
        - [github.com/binance-chain/tss-lib](https://github.com/binance-chain/tss-lib) – for threshold ECDSA (commonly used for BTC/ETH, but can be adapted if you set up ECDSA-based solutions)
        - [crypto/ed25519](https://pkg.go.dev/crypto/ed25519) – built-in Go library for basic Ed25519 signing. *(Note: Go’s standard library does **not** provide a fully built-in threshold Ed25519; you may need third-party libs or multi-signature aggregator logic.)*
        - [golang.org/x/crypto](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto) – extended cryptography packages, can be used for hashing, key derivation, etc.
    - **Usage**:
        - Each validator needs to hold a private key (or partial secret in a threshold scheme).
        - For threshold signatures (t-of-n), either use an **MPC-based** solution or a simpler approach like **multisig** on Solana (though that’s a different pattern than aggregated threshold sigs).
        - In an example aggregator flow, each validator signs the final distribution message with its private key, then sends the partial signature to the aggregator. The aggregator merges these signatures into a single valid signature if a threshold is met.
3. **Networking & Communication**
    - **Library**:
        - [github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p) – if you prefer a P2P network for validators to share data or partial signatures.
        - Or use standard **HTTP**/REST or **gRPC** with [google.golang.org/grpc](https://google.golang.org/grpc) to communicate partial signatures to the aggregator.
    - **Usage**:
        - Subset validators must exchange or send partial signatures to the aggregator.
        - The aggregator must broadcast the final transaction to the Solana cluster.
4. **Configuration & Logging**
    - **Library**:
        - [github.com/spf13/viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) for managing configs.
        - [github.com/sirupsen/logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus) or [github.com/rs/zerolog](https://github.com/rs/zerolog) for structured logging.
    - **Usage**:
        - Store cluster endpoint, tilt program ID, aggregator addresses, threshold parameters, etc.
        - Uniform logging across all validator nodes and aggregator.

## 3. Data Structures

Below is a sample of the minimal data structures you might define in Go.

```go
package tilt

// Info about the tilt's state fetched from on-chain
type TiltState struct {
    Balance      uint64
    BusinessRules []byte
    // Additional fields as needed, e.g. ephemeral weighting, sub-tilt references
}

// The final distribution result that each validator computes
type Distribution struct {
    Recipients []string  // or use solana.PublicKey
    Amounts    []uint64
}

// Partial signature and metadata to correlate it with the final distribution
type PartialSignature struct {
    ValidatorID  string
    Signature    []byte
    Distribution Distribution
}

// Aggregated signature result
type AggregatedSignature struct {
    Signature    []byte  // single aggregated signature
    Distribution Distribution
}

```

## 4. Validator Node Flow

1. **Startup & Initialization**
    - Load config (cluster endpoint, tilt program ID, local private key).
    - Initialize Solana RPC client (e.g., `solana-go.NewClient(...)`).
    - Optionally join a P2P or register with an aggregator for partial signature submissions.
2. **(Optional) Subset Selection**
    - If the node is selected to be part of the k-of-n subset, it enters the distribution cycle.
    - Subset might be determined on-chain (e.g., VRF) or by an off-chain random selection process.
    - **Implementation detail**: You might store a local flag `IsSelected = true` if chosen.
3. **Data Gathering from Solana**
    
    ```go
    tiltAccountInfo, err := solanaClient.GetAccountInfo(context.Background(), tiltPDA)
    if err != nil {
        // handle error
    }
    tiltState := parseTiltState(tiltAccountInfo.Data)
    
    ```
    
    - The `parseTiltState(...)` function reads the program’s custom data format.
    - Retrieve `Balance`, `BusinessRules`, `DistributionHistory`, etc.
4. **Compute Distribution**
    - Using the tilt’s business rules, each validator arrives at the same `(recipients[], amounts[])`.
    - Example pseudocode:
        
        ```go
        func computeDistribution(state *TiltState) Distribution {
            // 1. Evaluate ephemeral weighting or rules
            // 2. Derive recipients (sub-tilts, creators, protocol fee, etc.)
            // 3. Return distribution
            return Distribution{ ... }
        }
        
        ```
        
    - Make sure all validators produce **identical** results.
5. **Partial Signature Generation**
    - Construct a **message** to sign that includes:
        - `tiltID`
        - `recipients[]`
        - `amounts[]`
        - Possibly a **nonce** or block hash to avoid replay
    - Sign with Ed25519 or ECDSA-based threshold scheme:
        
        ```go
        messageBytes := buildDistributionMessage(tiltID, distribution)
        sig := ed25519.Sign(privateKey, messageBytes)
        partialSig := PartialSignature{
            ValidatorID:  validatorID,
            Signature:    sig,
            Distribution: distribution,
        }
        
        ```
        
    - Transmit `partialSig` to the aggregator (via gRPC, P2P, or HTTP).
6. **Verification & Consensus**
    - Each validator or aggregator node can cross-check that all partial signatures are signing the **same** distribution array.
    - If any mismatch is detected, the aggregator might request a re-computation or raise an alert.
7. **Aggregator Receives Partial Signatures**
    - If using a **threshold signature library** (e.g., TSS, BLS, etc.), the aggregator will combine partial signatures into a single signature.
    - If using **multiple signatures** (like a Solana multisig approach), it might just collect them in a single transaction structure.
8. **Aggregator Broadcast**
    - The aggregator forms and broadcasts the final transaction:
        
        ```go
        tx := buildExecuteDistributionTransaction(
            tiltID,
            distribution.Recipients,
            distribution.Amounts,
            aggregatedSignature,
        )
        solanaClient.SendTransaction(context.Background(), tx)
        
        ```
        
    - The Tilt program verifies the aggregated signature on-chain and executes the distribution if valid.

## 5. Example Folder Structure

```
tilt/
 ┣ cmd/
 ┃ ┗ tilt-validator/
 ┃    ┣ main.go                 // CLI entry point for validator node
 ┣ pkg/
 ┃ ┣ aggregator/
 ┃ ┃ ┗ aggregator.go            // aggregator logic
 ┃ ┣ tss/
 ┃ ┃ ┗ partial_signature.go     // threshold signature logic
 ┃ ┣ solana/
 ┃ ┃ ┗ client.go                // wrapper around solana-go
 ┃ ┗ tiltlogic/
 ┃    ┣ distribution.go         // computeDistribution(...)
 ┃    ┗ state.go                // parseTiltState(...), data structs
 ┗ go.mod

```

## 6. Security & Best Practices

- **Key Management**: Protect validator private keys (potentially using HSM or a secure keystore).
- **Replay Protection**: Incorporate blockhash or a unique ID in the signed message.
- **Threshold**: Decide on `k-of-n` (e.g., 3-of-5) in your TSS config and ensure partial key shares are never exposed.
- **Data Consistency**: Double-check all validators have identical `TiltState` data before computing final distribution.

---

## 7. Extending the Spec

1. **Protocol Fee**: If 20% goes to the protocol, incorporate logic in `computeDistribution(...)` that calculates this portion for the foundation wallet or DAO.
2. **Re-tries & Timeouts**: If aggregator does not receive enough partial signatures within a certain window, it can alert or trigger a fallback aggregator.
3. **Governance Integration**: If on-chain governance modifies the rules, have your validator automatically fetch new logic from the tilt program’s account.
4. **Subset Selection**: If you want an on-chain VRF approach, integrate with a VRF oracle or a Dapp that commits the randomly selected validator set to Solana.

---

## Conclusion

This **Go-based validator specification** provides a blueprint for:

1. **Interacting with Solana** for on-chain data (using `solana-go`).
2. **Computing the distribution** deterministically.
3. **Generating partial signatures** (using threshold signature libraries or standard Ed25519 if you adopt a simpler aggregator approach).
4. **Aggregating** partial signatures and broadcasting the final transaction on-chain.

With the above structure and libraries, you can build out your own validator nodes, aggregator service, and robust distribution workflow for **Tilt**. Feel free to adapt naming conventions, data structures, and threshold signing logic to your specific requirements and security constraints.
