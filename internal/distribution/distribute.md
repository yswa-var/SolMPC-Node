High-Level Implementation Plan
Fetch Tilt Data

- Load the TiltBusinessRules from on-chain (or a local simulation).
Verify that top-level splits (protocol, curator, publisher) sum to 10000 bps.
Process Top-Level Distribution

- Compute protocol_amount, curator_amount, publisher_amount.
Handle Curators Split (Local vs. Sub-Tilts)

- Allocate curator_amount among local curators and sub-tilts.
If sub-tilts exist, compute their share recursively.
Recursive Sub-Tilt Resolution

- For each referenced sub-tilt, fetch its TiltBusinessRules.
Apply the same distribution logic recursively.
Flatten Results & Summarize

- Merge recipient amounts, ensuring unique entries.
Handle edge cases like rounding, minimum deposit checks, and KYC.

Since we don't have real business rules yet, we need to design **dummy business rules** that are **realistic and representative** of how the system might work in practice. Hereâ€™s how you can implement this step by step:

---

## **1. Define Dummy Business Rules**
We need to create **plausible but simplified** business rules that a real system might have. These rules should cover:

### **Example Dummy Business Rules**
1. **Protocol Fee**: 2% of total distribution
2. **Curator Share**: 20% of total distribution, with a possible split among multiple curators
3. **Publisher Share**: 10% of total distribution
4. **Sub-Tilts**:
   - 50% of curator's share goes to Sub-Tilt A
   - 50% of curator's share goes to Sub-Tilt B

### **Example Rule Representation in Go**
```go
type BusinessRules struct {
    ProtocolFeeBps  uint16 // e.g., 200 (2%)
    CuratorBps      uint16 // e.g., 2000 (20%)
    PublisherBps    uint16 // e.g., 1000 (10%)
    SubTiltRules    []SubTiltRule
}

type SubTiltRule struct {
    TiltID string
    ShareBps uint16 // Percentage of the curator's share
}

// Example dummy rules
dummyRules := BusinessRules{
    ProtocolFeeBps:  200,  // 2%
    CuratorBps:      2000, // 20%
    PublisherBps:    1000, // 10%
    SubTiltRules: []SubTiltRule{
        {TiltID: "SubTiltA", ShareBps: 5000}, // 50% of curator's share
        {TiltID: "SubTiltB", ShareBps: 5000}, // 50% of curator's share
    },
}
```

---

## **2. Implement `computeDistribution` Function**
This function will:
1. Fetch the **TiltState** from the blockchain (we'll mock this for now).
2. Parse the **BusinessRules** (use dummy rules above).
3. Apply the rules to compute **distribution amounts**.
4. Handle sub-tilts **recursively**.
5. Return a flattened list of `(recipient, amount)`.

### **Implementation in Go**
```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

// Dummy structs
type Distribution struct {
    Recipients []string
    Amounts    []uint64
}

func computeDistribution(balance uint64, rules BusinessRules) Distribution {
    protocolShare := balance * uint64(rules.ProtocolFeeBps) / 10000
    curatorShare := balance * uint64(rules.CuratorBps) / 10000
    publisherShare := balance * uint64(rules.PublisherBps) / 10000
    remainingBalance := balance - (protocolShare + curatorShare + publisherShare)

    recipients := []string{"Protocol", "Publisher"}
    amounts := []uint64{protocolShare, publisherShare}

    // Split curator share among sub-tilts
    for _, subTilt := range rules.SubTiltRules {
        subAmount := curatorShare * uint64(subTilt.ShareBps) / 10000
        recipients = append(recipients, subTilt.TiltID)
        amounts = append(amounts, subAmount)
    }

    // If any remaining balance, assign it to main curator
    if remainingBalance > 0 {
        recipients = append(recipients, "Main Curator")
        amounts = append(amounts, remainingBalance)
    }

    return Distribution{Recipients: recipients, Amounts: amounts}
}

func main() {
    totalBalance := uint64(1000000) // Example: 1,000,000 lamports
    result := computeDistribution(totalBalance, dummyRules)

    fmt.Println("Distribution Result:")
    for i, recipient := range result.Recipients {
        fmt.Printf("%s: %d lamports\n", recipient, result.Amounts[i])
    }
}
```

---

## **3. Implement `parseTiltState` Function**
This function will:
- Deserialize data from blockchain.
- Convert byte array into `BusinessRules` struct.

For now, we can simulate the function returning our **dummy rules**.

```go
func parseTiltState(rawData []byte) BusinessRules {
    // Mocking parsed business rules (in real implementation, deserialize the byte array)
    return dummyRules
}
```

---

## **4. Testing the Implementation**
Test with different balances:
```go
func testComputeDistribution() {
    testBalances := []uint64{100000, 500000, 1000000}

    for _, balance := range testBalances {
        fmt.Printf("\nTesting with Balance: %d lamports\n", balance)
        result := computeDistribution(balance, dummyRules)
        for i, recipient := range result.Recipients {
            fmt.Printf("%s: %d lamports\n", recipient, result.Amounts[i])
        }
    }
}
```

---

## **5. Handling Recursive Sub-Tilts**
- If a sub-tilt itself has business rules, fetch and **apply** those rules.
- Use **recursion** to process nested sub-tilts.

```go
func computeRecursiveDistribution(balance uint64, rules BusinessRules) Distribution {
    result := computeDistribution(balance, rules)

    for i, recipient := range result.Recipients {
        if recipient == "SubTiltA" || recipient == "SubTiltB" {
            subRules := dummyRules // Assume we fetch real rules here
            subDist := computeDistribution(result.Amounts[i], subRules)
            result.Recipients = append(result.Recipients, subDist.Recipients...)
            result.Amounts = append(result.Amounts, subDist.Amounts...)
        }
    }
    return result
}
```

---

## **Next Steps**
1. **Integrate with Solana RPC**: Use `solana-go` SDK to fetch on-chain TiltState.
2. **Replace Dummy Rules with On-Chain Rules**: Fetch business rules from PDA.
3. **Optimize Performance**: Handle recursion limits and efficiency.
4. **Implement Signature Aggregation**: Ensure validators reach consensus.
